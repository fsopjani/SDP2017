    Strategy design pattern is a behavioural pattern, strategy pattern is an implementation of different specific algorithms
    and choosing one to use while the application is running.

    The strategy design pattern helps with encapsulation as each algorithm can be separately
    defined and then injected into the classes that use it. The different implementations are
    also interchangeable.

    The abstract factory design pattern is creational design pattern, it is used to encapsulate a group of factories that
    have some common logic in between.

    The abstract factory design pattern is useful when we want to expose a set of encapsulated factory objects
    e.g. database connectors. The clients become decoupled from the concrete classes.

    a. This is a structural pattern as it defines a manner for creating relationships between classes or entities.
       The facade design pattern is used to define a simplified interface to a more complex subsystem.
    b. Facade Design pattern is mainly used when building libraries or big systems and the idea is to have these build in
     methods/functions is to wrap these complex libraries/systems with simple interface in order to hide the usage of
     complexities and easy use of interface.

    The bridge design pattern
    The purpose of the bridge design pattern is to decouple an abstraction from its
    implementation so that the two can vary independently. It is useful when the class and its
    functionality vary a lot.

    The bridge design pattern eliminates a problem by directly implementing an abstraction,
    thus making the abstractions and implementations reusable and easier to change.
