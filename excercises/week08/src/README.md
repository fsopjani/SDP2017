    Strategy design pattern is a behavioural pattern, strategy pattern is an implementation of different specific algorithms
    and choosing one to use while the application is running.

    The strategy design pattern helps with encapsulation as each algorithm can be separately
    defined and then injected into the classes that use it. The different implementations are
    also interchangeable.

    The abstract factory design pattern is creational design pattern, it is used to encapsulate a group of factories that
    have some common logic in between.

    The abstract factory design pattern is useful when we want to expose a set of encapsulated factory objects
    e.g. database connectors. The clients become decoupled from the concrete classes.

5.

    The builder design pattern helps to create instances of classes using class methods (builder method) rather
    than using class constructors, this is particularly useful in cases where a class needs to cater multiple scenarios
    which require multiple versions of constructor. This can be quite limiting when in cases where needed to create instances
    of class a constructor is not defined for a particular need.

    a. This is a structural pattern as it defines a manner for creating relationships between classes or entities.
       The facade design pattern is used to define a simplified interface to a more complex subsystem.
    b. Facade Design pattern is mainly used when building libraries or big systems and the idea is to have these build in
     methods/functions is to wrap these complex libraries/systems with simple interface in order to hide the usage of
     complexities and easy use of interface.

    The bridge design pattern
    The purpose of the bridge design pattern is to decouple an abstraction from its
    implementation so that the two can vary independently. It is useful when the class and its
    functionality vary a lot.

    The bridge design pattern eliminates a problem by directly implementing an abstraction,
    thus making the abstractions and implementations reusable and easier to change.

    The composite is a partitioning design pattern that represents a group of objects that are to
    be treated as only one object.

    Its purpose is to compose objects into tree structures to represent whole-part hierarchies.
    The composite design pattern is useful for removing code duplication and avoiding errors
    in cases where groups of objects are generally treated the same way.

    What are the four participants of the Composite Design Pattern?
